        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This peach custard pie, a cross between peach pie and Southern chess pie, has just the right amount of peach to balance with the tender custard and the flaky crust. Blind baking the crust is optional, but it does ensure that the bottom crust will be crisp.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ready-to-bake single pie crust shell</li>
            <li>2 ripe peaches, peeled and sliced into eighths</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To blind bake the crust (optional): Chill pastry-filled pie pan at least 20 minutes before baking to prevent shrinkage.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line pastry with parchment or a double layer of aluminum foil and a layer of pie weights or dried beans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully remove the foil and weights, and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. The base of the crust will have turned a very light golden brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>For custard: combine eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl, and whisk vigorously until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add flour, cornmeal, salt, vanilla, vinegar, milk, and butter, and whisk vigorously until you achieve a smooth, emulsified batter, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange 12 peach slices on the bottom of the crust. Whisk batter again, and slowly ladle into the crust, being careful not to move the peach slices out of place.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until top is browned and a very sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. The pie should not be liquid, but jiggle when the pie dish is moved back and forth.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely before serving. For best results, chill in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
        </ol>
